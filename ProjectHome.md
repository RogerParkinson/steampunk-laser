The steampunk laser pistol uses a laser pointer (so it is a REAL laser) but that was a bit low key so I added two flashing LEDs and a buzzing/whirring noise. This was done with the attached code loaded into an Attiny85 running at 1 Mhz.

There are several ways to flash an Attiny. See the links to my blog for how I did it using a Teensy 2.0 board (like an Arduino, but smaller and with built in USB, again see the links).

I have added a link to the 3D model I used for the gun handle (in shapeways) and the model source is in the downloads here.
